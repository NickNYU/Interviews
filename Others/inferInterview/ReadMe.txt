By using topology sort to solve this problem, it's a typically DFS in graph's algorithm
 
So, the Time Complexity should be O(n), n is the number of graph nodes


Class GraphNode is as a node in graph

Class Main has a main function, and do the main part of job (read from stdin, build the graph, topology sort)
